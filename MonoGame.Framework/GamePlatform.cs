(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to
make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of
its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the
software.

3. Conditions and Limitations

(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
to the software ends automatically.
